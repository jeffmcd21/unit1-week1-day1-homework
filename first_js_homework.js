// Section 1
    // 1. DRY means "Don't Repeat Yourself" i.e. avoid repeating code whenver possible. We should pay attention to it for the benefit of maintenance, readability, 
    //      less code required, better performance and execution. The use of Functions, Modules, Variables, & Abstract are all useful tools for writing DRY code.

    // 2. const: Block scope, Immutable(cannot be reassigned); let: Block scope, mutable (can be reassigned); var: Function or global scope, mutable (can be reassigned)
